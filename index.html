        <h2>DO THIS FIRST: <a href="https://forms.gle/35NX9FRruViPy6vo9">Sign up here</a></h2>
        <p>Filling out this form does not commit you to anything - we encourage you to fill it out even if you're not very sure yet whether you'd like to attend this year. Everyone who does end up camping with us will need to fill out this form eventually.</p>

        <div class="dues-section">
            <h2>Dues</h2>
            <p>Please make sure your dues are in to <b>(info provided after you fill in the form above)</b> via Venmo or Paypal! We need this money to feed you, run our trucks, and make sure we keep our commitments to each other and Placement! You may not camp with us if you have not paid dues!</p>

            <p>in <b>addition</b> to your burning man ticket which you bought separately</p>
            <h3>How much do we want?</h3>
            
            <div class="dues-option">
                <h4>$550.00</h4>
                <p>Dues are an integral part of camping at Next Year on Luna, as they allow us to do what we do best: not die in the desert. These dues are the same as last year - we've done the research and planning to ensure that dues are as efficient as possible, while still allowing us to be the badasses we are.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dues-option">
                <h4>or $325.00</h4>
                <p>While the camp budget works out assuming people pay an average of $550, we don't want you to miss out on camping with us if that's just a bit too much for you to afford. If $550 is beyond your means, you can opt-into paying $325 instead. This option is not available if you're late on your dues - after July 31st, the regular dues apply.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dues-option">
                <h4>or $850.00</h4>
                <p>If you are a Friend of The Camp who wants the camp to be better in various ways (more comfortable, more impressive), you can help substantially by paying the higher tier instead. By paying this amount, you are subsidizing one of your campmates who can't afford the regular dues - someone else gets to go to Burning Man with us because of you. Last year, about 20% of the camp were Friends of the Camp.</p>

        <h2>(After you signup and hear back) Bike rentals are now open!</h2>
        <p>We're teaming up with Playa Bike Repair again this year to offer bike rentals for our camp. You can reserve your bike online, and they'll be placed onto a trailer and towed to Burning Man. Bikes will be ready for pickup directly on playa. Reserve your bike here: <a href="https://bit.ly/NYOL2025">https://bit.ly/NYOL2025</a></p>

        <p>Be sure to use that link! It connects your order with our camp and gives you a $25 discount. In the Name of your camp field, enter NYOL</p>
        
        <div class="pricing-list">
            <h3>Bike Rental Pricing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$150 (with our group discount) until July 31</li>
                <li>$175 (with our group discount) starting August 1</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Do you need a ticket? We may have one left</h2>

        <h2>First year? Get Orientated!</h2>
        <p>We'll be having remote discussion sessions via Discord on what you need to be ready for playa, Burning Man Principles, camp behavior expectations and more. This is mandatory to attend for anyone who hasn't camped with us before.</p>
        <p>Sessions will be short (30 minutes) and are required by BMOrg in return for placement and Stewards Sale privileges.</p>

        <h2>Vibes</h2>
        <p>We're continuing the tradition of a roll call channel, this year's is roll-call-2025. Please post a picture and blurb about yourself so your campmates know who you are! If you've done this for the previous year and would rather not do another introduction, we'll forward your message from the previous year.</p>

        <h2>Chore signups! Volunteer/Chore Shifts</h2>
        <p>Add Yourself to the People Sheet: (link provided after signup and dues)</p>
        <p>Our camp provides its members with food and shared facilities. We also provide art and gifts for the community. In order to make that happen, we need everyone in the camp to help out with camp food or with running the cafe.</p>
        <p>Each member must commit to at least two chore shifts. This year's shifts are longer but more comprehensive, so cooking and cleaning have been consolidated per meal. If you would like to help and can manage additional shifts beyond the minimum, the camp benefits significantly. Certain shifts like burn night cook are also especially helpful.</p>
        <p>Prioritize core shifts over overflow slots. Essential camp functions need coverage first. Consider coordinating with a friend to take a shift with someone you know.</p>

        <h3>What are some features of this camp?</h3>
        <div class="features-list">

        <h3>What is Burning Man like?</h3>
        <p><strong>When & Where:</strong> Aug 24-Sep 1, in the desert in north Nevada</p>
        <p>It is a city built in an enormous flat desert that is made of a single substance (dust). There are no plants or land features or bugs or anything. All the things there are the things that the people in the city brought, and they bring beautiful strange surplus and share it with you freely.</p>
        <p>Googling this question is helpful - the things that people like about it are often pretty personal and diverse.</p>

        <h4>What makes it special:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is totally apart from Society and is instead some other society, which makes it a good container for thinking about your life</li>
            <li>Self-reliance and making things with your campmates can be meaningful</li>
            <li>You can help people have a better Burning Man (like becoming a ranger - a volunteer position where you walk around the city solving people's problems and you have a radio)</li>
            <li>Some people like to get high or do weird sex stuff - those activities are abundantly available</li>
            <li>You can ride your bike and look at pretty art all week and not run out</li>
            <li>If you want, you get to help build big things from metal, or bring your own art or whatever</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Practical considerations:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It's hot in the day and cold at night and always dusty</li>
            <li>Survival isn't that hard - it's just camping</li>
            <li>The camp provides some infrastructure (shade, meals, being in a good place in the city, etc)</li>
            <li>Important to know going in that Burning Man does, like, suck</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wait, I heard getting tickets is really hard?</h3>
        <p>Eh, we're not really in the tickets-are-scarce paradigm anymore. You get them on Facebook Marketplace for around face price.</p>
